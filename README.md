# Yelp Look-A-Like Using React-Native

## Deployment
  No deployment for this application. This was just made for testing purposes. This is my first React-Native Application.

## How Was It Made
  Utilizing the Yelp API, I was able to gather information from an axios call. Thereafter, I used that information and built Parent and Child components to render the information on the screen. The App utilizes a nice "V" like modularization, just like, "MVC" (Model View Controller).

## Why React-Native?
  I normally build React web applications. Not mobile applications. However, when I saw that there was a library similar to React that I gave it a shot. Building experience in other aspects of development is what excites me. Getting to do something that I have never done, or building able something that I only dreamed of as a child is what fulfills my drive to learn every aspect of developing.
